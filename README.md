Student Depression Dataset Analysis
Objective:- Analysing, understanding depression levels among students. It may include features such as demographic information (age, gender), academic performance (grades, attendance), lifestyle habits (sleep patterns, exercise, social activities), and mental health history.
Tools Used:-  
Python:- Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualisations. 
Methodologies Used:-
1.	Data Cleaning:- After importing the data from StudentDepressionDataset.csv, dealt with null values and wrong data, and eliminated irrelevant data such as job satisfaction and work stress. 
2.	EDA: Analysed the relationship between various types of categorical and numerical data, such as how Dietary Habits impacted their CGPA, Gender, Family History of mental illness and whether or not there are suicidal thoughts.
3.	Visualisation Techniques: Used Histplot, ScatterPlot, kde Plot, BarPlots, CountPlot, BoxPlot, ViolinPlot, StripPlot, SwarmPlot and CatPlot.
•	Final Outcomes:   Students are under heavy academic pressure, getting very little sleep, often eating unhealthily, facing moderate financial stress, and nearly half have a family history of mental illness all contributing to high rates of depression and suicidal thoughts.
•	Students end up sacrificing their sleep to perform better academically. 
•	Dietary Habits: Healthy eaters tend to perform slightly better academically. Unhealthy eaters often have slightly lower GPAS. This concludes that poor nutrition affects energy, focus and memory.
•	Depression: Female Students tended to have a lower rate of depression compared to their male peers. 
•	Suicidal Thoughts: Male Students tended to have more suicidal thoughts compared to female students.
